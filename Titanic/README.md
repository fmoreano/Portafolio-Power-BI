This paper analyzes the dataset of passengers and crew members of the RMS Titanic, highlighting survival rates based on various factors such as sex, age, and passenger class. The dataset includes information about survival, demographics, and ticket fares.

Introduction:
The RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City in April 1912. This tragic event resulted in significant loss of life, with only a fraction of passengers and crew surviving.

Data Overview:
The dataset contains detailed records of 891 individuals on the Titanic, including their age, sex, survival status, passenger class, and fare.

Total individuals: 891
Total survivors: 340 (38.2%)
Total fatalities: 551 (61.8%)
Survival Analysis:

By Sex:

Males: 233 survived (26.15%)
Females: 109 survived (12.23%)
Overall, females had a higher survival rate compared to males.
By Age Group:

Infants (0-1 years): High survival rate
Young adults (16-30 years): Moderate survival rate
Middle-aged adults (31-50 years): Lower survival rate
Older adults (51+ years): Lowest survival rate
By Passenger Class:

First class: Highest survival rate
Second class: Moderate survival rate
Third class: Lowest survival rate
Fare Analysis:
The average fare paid varied significantly by passenger class and age group. First-class passengers paid the highest fares, followed by second and third-class passengers. There was also a notable variation in fares within the same class, likely reflecting different cabin types and locations.

Conclusion:
The survival rates of the Titanic disaster varied significantly based on sex, age, and passenger class. Females, particularly those in first class, had the highest survival rates. Infants also had relatively high survival rates, while older adults and third-class passengers faced the highest mortality rates. This analysis underscores the significant impact of socio-economic status and demographics on survival outcomes in maritime disasters.
